# ðŸ”¬ Design documents

The **design documents** (or "design docs", more commonly) describe potential designs. These docs vary greatly in terms of their readiness to be implemented:

* Early on, they describe a vague idea for a future. Often this takes the shape of capturing constraints on the solution, rather than the solution itself.
* When a feature is getting ready to ship, they can evolve into a full blown RFC, with links to tracking issues or other notes.

## Early stage design docs

In the early stages, design docs are meant to capture interesting bits of "async design space". They are often updated to capture the results of a fruitful conversation or thread which uncovered contraints or challenges in solving a particular problem. They will capture a combination of the following:

* use cases;
* interesting aspects to the design;
* alternatives;
* interactions with other features.

## Late stage design docs

As a design progresses, the doc should get more and more complete, until it becomes something akin to an RFC. (Often, at that point, we will expand the design document into a directory, adding an actual RFC draft and other contents; those things can live in this repo or elsewhere, depending.) Once we decide to put a design doc onto the roadmap, it will also contain links to tracking issues or other places to track the status.
