# ðŸ’¬ Conversations

This section contains notes and summaries from conversations that we have had with people are using Rust and async and describing their experiences. These conversations and links are used as "evidence" when building [the "status quo" section][sq].

[sq]: vision/status_quo.md

## Not exhaustive nor mandatory

This section is not meant to be an "exhaustive list" of all sources. That would be impossible. Many conversations are short, not recorded, and hard to summaize. Others are subject to NDA. We certainly don't require that all claims in the [status quo][sq] section are backed by evidence found here. Still, it's useful to have a place to dump notes and things for future reference.
