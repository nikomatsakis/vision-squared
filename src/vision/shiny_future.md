# âœ¨ Shiny future: Where we want to get to

The "shiny future" is here to tell you what we are trying to build over the next 2-3 years. That is, it presents our "best guess" as to what will look like a few years from now. When describing specific features, it also embeds links to [design notes] that describe the constraints and general plans around that feature.

[design notes]: ../design_notes.md

Predicting the future is a tricky business! Many of the things described in the "shiny future" doc have a lot of uncertainty. We fully expect that the designs and narratives described in this document will change as we work towards realizing them. When there are areas of particular uncertainty, we use the Frequently Asked Questions and the design docs to call them out.

**Help wanted.** This is not a static document! There are lots of ways you can help to expand it! Take a look at the [How to Vision Doc](./how_to_vision_doc.md) for more details.
