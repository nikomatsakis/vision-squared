# ðŸ˜± Status quo stories

## What is this

The "status quo" stores are here to state our "theory of the case". That is, they present (and prove) our hypotheses as to what the various challenges are for users of Async I/O in Rust. These hypotheses are presented in narrative form, by telling the story of a specific [character] as they try (and typically fail in dramatic fashion) to achieve their goals.

[character]: ./characters.md

### Based on a true story

These stories are not made up. They are always based on real-life experiences of actual people. Each story contains a "Frequently Asked Questions" section, and that will include notes the sources used to create the story. In some cases, it may link to notes or summaries in the [conversations] section, though that is not required. The "Frequently Asked Questions" section also contains a summary of what the "morals" of the story are (i.e., what are the key takeaways), along with answers to questions that people have raised along the way.

[conversations]: ../conversations.md

### The stories provide data we use to prioritize, not a prioritization itself

**Just because a user story is represented here doesn't mean we're going to be able to fix it right now.** Some of these user stories will indicate more severe problems than others. As we consider the stories, we'll select some subset to try and address; that choice is reflected in the [roadmap].

[roadmap]: ./roadmap.md

### Help wanted!

This is not a static document! There are lots of ways you can help to expand it! Take a look at the [How to Vision Doc](./how_to_vision_doc.md) for more details.

## Alan has trouble getting started

| [Alan] | [Alan has a blast standing up a web server](./shiny_future.md#alan-has-a-blast-standing-up-a-web-server) | Shane and estebank |

Outline:

* At first, [Alan] can't find docs about how to do async stuff
* Alan finds learning Rust challenging enough, learning async at the same time is even harder ([cite](https://twitter.com/richardsabow/status/1345815115745140736))
* Alan has trouble picking a runtime, it's kind of overwhelming -- [what if he picks the wrong one?](https://twitter.com/EchoRior/status/1359965313979346944)
* Alan is confused because adding async/await doesn't seem to be getting him concurrency
* Alan tries to connect to a database but the docs aren't very comprehensive
* Alan doesn't like the web framework he's using, but the one he likes requires a different runtime, and switching between them is a real pain
* Alan quits and becomes a [Bob Ross] groupy

<details><summary>ðŸ¤” <b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></summary>
<p>

* **What are the morals of the story?**
    * Many people cite that picking a runtime is a stressful choice.
    * People want to be able to 'mix and match' the runtime, web framework, and other libraries and have things just work.
    * Information on async-await is hard to find and not yet well integrated into standard Rust learning materials.
    * Rust's async model is different from other languages (JavaScript, C#) and that can be confusing.
    * Learning async Rust is strictly more work than learning sync Rust, which is already harder than we'd like.
    * The async book as written gives way too many low-level details way too early.
* **Are you just making this stuff up?**
    * Not at all. This is based on a number of sources, including tweets but also personal conversations.
    * Some sources can be found in the conversations page:
        * [2021-02-12 Twitter thread](../conversations/2021-02-12-Twitter-Thread.md)
* **Why doesn't Alan go to the tutorial for some specific runtime?**
    * It's true that there are a number of excellent tutorials out there, like the one from [tokio](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial) and [async-std](https://book.async.rs/tutorial/index.html). Unfortunately, Alan doesn't know about those runtimes yet! Alan wants to learn Rust, so that's where he started.

## Alan finds the experience of writing async code is a lot more painful than sync code

| Character | Shiny Future | Assigned To |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Alan] | not yet written | âœ‹ [Volunteer wanted] âœ‹ |

Outline:

* [Alan] gets inscrutable backtraces
* Alan tries to write a recursive function and gets a weird error
* Alan gets confusing diagnostics because of incompatible versions of the futures crate
* Alan gets a confusing compiler error about a variable being live across an await point that doesnâ€™t seem to be live
* Bobs gets an error message that exceeds the memory limits in his terminal program, crashes his computer, and forces him to reboot

## Grace tries to write a stream and pin breaks her mind

| [Grace] | [Grace discovers the joy of generators](./shiny_future.html#grace-discovers-the-joy-of-generators) | âœ‹ [Volunteer wanted] âœ‹ |

Outline:

* We need to make this better -- pick some specific problem Grace was trying to solve
* She winds up implementing a stream and has to use pin and it's hard
* we donâ€™t currently provide any language support for doing this
* so you have to work with pin
* it is very confusing and nobody really understands it
* she doesnâ€™t get parallel like she wanted
* she switches to a stream of futures 
* it kind of works but itâ€™s a pain to maintain and she doesnâ€™t like fixing bugs in that code
    * she transfers to another team and somebody else deletes the file, starts over, and repeats her experience

[Grace deploys her service and is able to fix problems]: ./shiny_future.md#grace-deploys-her-service-and-is-able-to-fix-problems

Outline:

* She gets stack traces from her production users and they are 10s of KB and she canâ€™t make heads or tails of them
    * Back in the olden days of C# they were able to fix bugs more often than not based just on the stack trace, but now they canâ€™t even figure out what code it is talking about
* Tasks are stuck
* Performance is good but one customer has 10x latency â€”- why?
* She wants to use tracing but itâ€™s not stable

    * [rio](https://crates.io/crates/rio) -- "but users should beware that use-after-free bugs are still possible without unsafe when using rio."

## Niklaus goes to write SLOW but itâ€™s annoying

| [Niklaus] | not yet written | seanmonstar? |

Outline:

* async fns in traits maybe come into this story?
* to make it work across many runtimes he has to juggle a lot of feature gates 
* the AsyncRead trait is in the futures crate, but he canâ€™t tell how stable that crate is â€” can he rely on it in his public interface? Can he call that 1.0?
    * futures crate makes a breaking change, is he screwed?
* he has to copy and paste a bunch of random utilities that everyone seems to use but which arenâ€™t defined in a shared crate that has a stable version
    * xxx some of them are in futures??
* maybe he wants to target WASM?

## Niklaus builds his web framework

| [Niklaus] | not yet written | âœ‹ [Volunteer wanted] âœ‹ |

Outline:

* He is frustrated by lack of async trait support
* He uses the `async-trait` procedural macro but it feels weird to have that in a public, stable API.
* As with the SLOW library, he would to make it independent of a specific runtime, but that's very difficult
